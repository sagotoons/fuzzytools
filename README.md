# fuzzytools

The Fuzzy Tools add-on is a collection of tools, as demonstrated during my presentation 'Journey Towards an Efficient 1-Person Pipeline' at BCON23, which you can see here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01lQrcCz9s

Fuzzy Tools includes the following:

# 1. Scene Builder
Quickly set up your scene, including:
- optimized camera(s)
- floor with shadow only
- stylized sky/world
- sunlight and backlight
- enable and optimize EEVEE settings like AO, Bloom and Color Management

_Scene Builder is specifically optimized for EEVEE, but many aspects still work outside of EEVEE._

# 2. Fuzzy Viewport
...

# 3. Camera Control
Quick access to important camera properties, including:
- Focal Length
- Camera Clipping
