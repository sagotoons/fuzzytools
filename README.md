The Fuzzy Tools add-on is a collection of tools, heavily focused on efficiency and a quick workflow with a multi-camera scene in mind. Some of Fuzzy Tools was demonstrated during my presentation 'Journey Towards an Efficient 1-Person Pipeline' at BCON23, which you can see here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01lQrcCz9s

_Fuzzy Tools is specifically created for a fast EEVEE pipeline, but many aspects still work in Cycles._
