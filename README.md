The Fuzzy Tools add-on is a collection of tools, heavily focused on efficiency and a quick workflow with a multi-camera scene in mind. Some of Fuzzy Tools was demonstrated during my presentation 'Journey Towards an Efficient 1-Person Pipeline' at BCON23, which you can see here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=W01lQrcCz9s

Fuzzy Tools creates the following panels in the sidebar (N):

## 1. Scene Builder
Quickly set up your scene, including:
- optimized camera(s)
- floor with shadow only
- world shader with stylized sky
- sunlight and backlight
- optimized EEVEE settings like AO and Bloom

_Scene Builder is specifically created for an EEVEE pipeline, but many aspects still work outside of EEVEE._

## 2. Fuzzy Viewport
Quick access to several settings, including:
- Use Simplify
- Hide/Unhide all Hair

## 3. Camera Control
Quick access to several camera settings and operators, including:
- Focal Length
- Camera Clipping
- DoF
- Bind Camera to Marker
- Animate Motion Blur with Markers

## And more...
Alt+M to Move Keyframes and Markers

## To install
- download the fuzzy_tools.py file
- in Blender, go to Preferences -> Add-ons. Click on 'Install' and find the .py file. Select file and click 'Install Add-on'
- after successful installation, the add-on should appear in the add-ons list. Click the checkbox beside the add-on to enable it
- to enable/disable Fuzzy Tools afterwards, go to Preferences -> Add-ons. Make sure 'Community' is enabled, then search for 'fuzzy' in the search bar to find the add-on
